# Zombie
Game made for GameDev Final
This is a small project I want to flesh out; everthing added in the initial Commit "Game Dev Final" I did during finals week. 

# Controls
WASD- Move
Left Click- Fire
H- Use Medpack

# Instructions
If a Zombie touches you, you'll start losing health. If a healthy NPC loses all its health, it'll become infected. If you lose all your health, you die and the game ends. Health packs are wooden boxes, ammo pack is blue. Kill all the infected to win!
